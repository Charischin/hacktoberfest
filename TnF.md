# Track and Field
Track and field is an activity in which participants are able to develop both their skills and values. 
Skills are through tedious training, as well as efforts put into correcting of posture, techniques etc. With time, one is able to improve oneself, contributing to better performances. 
On the other hand, the values are earned through experiences, either in-CCA or during competitions. One has to learn teamwork as they work with their teammates, especially for team events (relays). During competitions, one would also have to exercise sportsmanship and humility. Whatever the outcome, we must always win or lose graciously.
